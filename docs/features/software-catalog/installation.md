title: Installing in your Backstage App
description: Documentation on How to install Backstage Plugin
---

The catalog plugin comes in two packages, `@backstage/plugin-catalog` and
`@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`. Each has their own installation steps,
outlined below.

## Installing @backstage/plugin-catalog

> **Note that if you used `npx @backstage/create-app`, the plugin may already be
> present**

The catalog frontend plugin should be installed in your `app` package, which is
created as a part of `@backstage/create-app`. To install the package, run:

```bash
cd packages/app
yarn add @backstage/plugin-catalog
```

Make sure the version of `@backstage/plugin-catalog` matches the version of
other `@backstage` packages. You can update it in `packages/app/package.json` if
it doesn't.

### Adding the Plugin to your `packages/app`

Add the following entry to the head of your `packages/app/src/plugins.ts`:

```ts
export { plugin as CatalogPlugin } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog';
```

Add the following to your `packages/app/src/apis.ts`:

```ts
import { catalogApiRef, CatalogClient } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog';

// Inside the ApiRegistry builder function ...

builder.add(
  catalogApiRef,
  new CatalogClient({
    apiOrigin: backendUrl,
    basePath: '/catalog',
  }),
);
```

Where `backendUrl` is the `backend.baseUrl` from config, i.e.
`const backendUrl = config.getString('backend.baseUrl')`.

The catalog components depend on a number of other
[Utility APIs](../../api/utility-apis.md) to function, including at least the
`ErrorApi` and `StorageApi`. You can find an example of how to install these in
your app
[here](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/61c3a7e5b750dc7c059ef16b188594d31b2c04c2/packages/app/src/apis.ts#L80).

## Gotchas that we will fix

Since the catalog plugin currently ships with a sentry plugin `InfoCard`
installed by default, you'll need to set `sentry.organization` in your
`app-yaml.yaml`. For example:

```yaml
sentry:
  organization: Acme Corporation
```

If you've created an app with an older version of `@backstage/create-app` or
`@backstage/cli create-app`, be sure to remove the Welcome plugin from the app,
as that will conflict with the catalog routes.

## Installing @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend

> **Note that if you used `npx @backstage/create-app`, the plugin may already be
> present**

The catalog backend should be installed in your `backend` package, which is
created as a part of `@backstage/create-app`. To install the package, run:

```bash
cd packages/backend
yarn add @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend
```

Make sure the version of `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend` matches the version
of other `@backstage` packages. You can update it in
`packages/backend/package.json` if it doesn't.

### Adding the Plugin to your `packages/backend`

You'll need to add the plugin to the `backend`'s router. You can do this by
creating a file called `packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts` with the
following contents to get you up and running quickly.

```ts
import {
  createRouter,
  DatabaseEntitiesCatalog,
  DatabaseLocationsCatalog,
  DatabaseManager,
  HigherOrderOperations,
  LocationReaders,
  runPeriodically,
} from '@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend';
import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
import { useHotCleanup } from '@backstage/backend-common';

export default async function createPlugin({
  logger,
  database,
}: PluginEnvironment) {
  const locationReader = new LocationReaders(logger);

  const db = await DatabaseManager.createDatabase(database, { logger });
  const entitiesCatalog = new DatabaseEntitiesCatalog(db);
  const locationsCatalog = new DatabaseLocationsCatalog(db);
  const higherOrderOperation = new HigherOrderOperations(
    entitiesCatalog,
    locationsCatalog,
    locationReader,
    logger,
  );

  useHotCleanup(
    module,
    runPeriodically(() => higherOrderOperation.refreshAllLocations(), 10000),
  );

  return await createRouter({
    entitiesCatalog,
    locationsCatalog,
    higherOrderOperation,
    logger,
  });
}
```

Once the `catalog.ts` router setup file is in place, add the router to
`packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

```ts
import catalog from './plugins/catalog';

const catalogEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('catalog'));

const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
  .loadConfig(configReader)
  /** several different routers */
  .addRouter('/catalog', await catalog(catalogEnv));
```

### Adding Entries to the Catalog

At this point the catalog backend is installed in your backend package, but you
will not have any entities loaded.

To get up and running and try out some templates quickly, you can add some of
our example templates through static configuration. Add the following to the
`catalog.locations` section in your `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    # Backstage Example Component
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/artist-lookup-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/playback-order-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/podcast-api-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/queue-proxy-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/searcher-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/playback-lib-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/www-artist-component.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/examples/shuffle-api-component.yaml
```

### Running the Backend

Finally, start up the backend with the new configuration:

```bash
cd packages/backend
yarn start
```

If you've also set up the frontend plugin, so you should be ready to go browse
the catalog at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) now!
